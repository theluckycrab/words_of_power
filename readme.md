# !!Don't Panic!!

If you're not used to GitHub or versioning software, I realize this can be overwhelming. The rulebook is hosted in this format because it's a living document and comparing versions is painful. You can safely ignore everything and just grab the latest pdf from the "Releases" section to the right ----->

Thanks for playing ^_^

If you are used to GitHub, you'll need pandoc to convert the markdown to a pdf.
